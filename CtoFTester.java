//-Create a java program with a class name of CtoFTester.java
//-Create two functions, celsiusToFahrenheit and fahrenheitToCelsius
//-BEFORE Writing the code, think about the following questions:
//    -What should the functions have as parameter(s) ? What type should they be?
//    -What should the functions return?
//-Compile and run as you write this, using a main function to run and test your two functions.
//-Commit any time you make progress towards your goal!
